# UoA Discords / Server Archive

The Minecraft server running at `archive.uoa-discords.com` is a "spectate-only" version of the previous server.

You can still use commands like `/warp` to visit old locations, but you cannot build or break blocks.

This server will stop running on **Friday 5th July at 8pm**.

You can download the world files [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UGwb2MDdy1aDeX7fUIm8dQyvPEwUhmqp/view?usp=sharing), this may be removed from Google drive on the **5th of July** as well, so be sure to download it beforehand.
